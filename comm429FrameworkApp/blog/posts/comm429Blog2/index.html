      <h2>Some (maybe) Common Mistakes with configuring 11ty and Tailwind to show markdown files</h2>
<p>This is a short guide on how to use 11ty and tailwind to display a pre-existing markdown file.</p>
<p>To show my blog and other things, I created a static site using 11ty and Tailwind CSS.</p>
<p>While the site looked nice, when I tried to put up my pre-existing blog post, nothing looked right!</p>
<p>Here is what the blog post is supposed to look like:</p>
<p><img src="../../../assets/blog_after.png" alt="blog_after"></p>
<p>And here is what I saw:</p>
<p><img src="../../../assets/blog_before.png" alt="blog_before"></p>
<p>As you can see, its just plain old text. No headings, no code-blocks.</p>
<p>To fix this I did some trouble shooting.</p>
<h2>Tailwind overrides my defaults</h2>
<p>The main issue comes from Tailwind. As it turned out, the default styles for markdown were overridden.</p>
<p>For a new file, this might be ok, you could just write it using Tailwind styles. But, in the case of an old file, re-writing my blog post would be tedious.</p>
<p>This is especially the case for someone who is moving their entire blog from another site to a Tailwind site, while re-writing one post maybe tolerable, re-writing years of blogging is not.</p>
<h2>So, what's the fix?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, other people did the complaining for me, and Tailwind released a plugin to allow the default styles.</p>
<p>The plugin is called Tailwind CSS Typeography. For additional info about it, click the link <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-typography">here</a>.</p>
<p>To import the plugin you will need to open your tailwind configuration file, 'tailwind.config.js'.</p>
<p>In the file, go to the pluins array (or create one if its not there), and add the plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code>plugins: [
  ...,
  require('@tailwindcss/typography')
],
</code></pre>
<p>The plugin adds a new set of 'prose' classes that will make any vanilla markdown files look as they were intended to.</p>
<p>To apply one of the classes, simply go the layout you are using for your blog posts and add a div tag around the content block like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;prose lg:prose-xl&quot;&gt;

  {{ content | safe }}

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With that your markdown file should be looking mostly normal.</p>
<p>Mostly? Thats right, there is one more issue.</p>
<h2>The code-blocks still aren't working!</h2>
<p>If you're using the default 11ty settings, the code-blocks in your markdown files still won't look right.</p>
<p>By default, 11ty disables indented code-blocks. This is because the code-block feature can mess with retrieved content or shortcode that happens to contain indents.</p>
<h2>So, what's the fix?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, this is easy to re-enable. The method I'm using is found <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/markdown/">here</a> in the 11ty docs.</p>
<p>To do so, you will need to go to your 'eleventy.js' file and use 'ammendLibrary' like so:</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = function(eleventyConfig){
    eleventyConfig.amendLibrary(&quot;md&quot;, (mdLib) =&gt; mdLib.enable(&quot;code&quot;));
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this, your code-blocks should now re-appear and your markdown files should look like they do on any other site.</p>
